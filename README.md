## About

This project is step one towards an MVP. The idea is an app that is a bucketlist/checklist for the U.S. National Parks a person has been to or would like to visit. The app will have a photo and basic info of each National Park (hopefully all 63 of them, but only a handful at the moment). This will be the home page, and accessible to anyone, and there is a link to signin/signup. After a person is signed in, they can mark all the parks they've visited, mark parks to add to their "bucket list", view lists of those, as well as write journal entries about the parks they've visited. (The currently displayed "Been List" and "Bucket List" buttons will only be visible once the user is authenticated.) Once the database/backend is implemented, the user will be able to sign in and their journal entries and lists will be saved for later access.
